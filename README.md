Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.

The word Web Development is made up of two words, that is:

   **What is HTML?**

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design web pages on the internet. It was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 at CERN as a simple markup language. Since then, it has evolved through versions from HTML 2.0 to HTML5 (the latest 2024 version).

HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and Markup language defines the text document within the tag.



**What is CSS?**

CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a stylesheet language used to add styles to the HTML document. It describes how HTML elements should be displayed on the web page.

CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie in 1994 and later developed by Lie and Bert Bos, who published the CSS1 specification in 1996.
Basic CSS Example

CSS has 3 ways to style your HTML:

    Inline: Add styles directly to HTML elements (limited use).
    Internal: Put styles inside the HTML file in a <style> tag.
    External: Create a separate CSS file (.css) and link it to your HTML.


**What is JavaScript ?**

JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.

JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.
